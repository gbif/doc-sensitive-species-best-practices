msgid "The unprotected distribution of Sensitive Primary Species Occurrence Data (for example the exact localities of rare, endangered or commercially valuable taxa) was a concern of https://www.gbif.org[GBIF] – the Global Biodiversity Information Facility – from its beginning. The GBIF Secretariat has a vested interest in making data available via its portals, but at the same time respecting the wishes of data providers to restrict information on sensitive taxa. In early 2006, GBIF initiated a process to address this issue, especially in relation to data to be shared through the GBIF network and made visible through https://www.gbif.org[GBIF.org^] and other data aggregating initiatives."
msgstr "La distribution non protégée des données primaires d'occurrences d'espèces sensibles (par exemple la localisation exacte des espèces rares, des taxons en danger ou à valeur commerciale) était une préoccupation du https://www.gbif.org[GBIF] – Global Biodiversity Information Facility - (Système mondial d'information sur la biodiversité) depuis ses débuts. Le secrétariat du GBIF a tout intérêt à rendre les données disponibles via ses portails, tout en respectant la volonté des fournisseurs de données de restreindre l'information sur les taxons sensibles. Début 2006, le GBIF a initié un processus pour résoudre ce problème, particulièrement en ce qui concerne les données partagées via le réseau GBIF et rendues visibles via https://www.gbif.org[GBIF.org^] et d'autres initiatives d'agrégation des données."

msgid "The final step in that process was to develop a _Guide to Best Practices for Primary Species Occurrence Data_. That document was proposed as an overriding guideline for institutions, data providers and GBIF Nodes to use to develop their own in-house guidelines. Organizations and institutions were encouraged to produce their own internal documents that incorporated the practices outlined in the _Guide_ and related documents such as the https://doi.org/10.15468/doc-2zpf-zf42[_Guide to Best Practices for Georeferencing_^] (Chapman and Wieczorek 2006) and incorporate them into their own working environment. Unfortunately, not as many institutions have taken up the challenge and produced their own internal documents as we had hoped. Two key agencies that have done so, however, are SANBI in South Africa (http://biodiversityadvisor.sanbi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SANBI-Biodiversity-Information-Policy-Series-Digital-Access-to-Sensitive-Taxon.pdf[SANBI 2010^]) and the Atlas of Living Australia (https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/ALA-sensitive-data-report-and-proposed-policy-v1.1.pdf[Tann and Flemons 2009^], https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000195500-what-is-sensitive-data-[ALA 2018a^]) (see <<Implementations,Implementations>>)."
msgstr "La dernière étape de ce processus consistait à élaborer un _Guide des bonnes pratiques pour les données primaires sur les occurrences d'espèces_. Ce document a été proposé comme directive importante pour les institutions, les fournisseurs de données et les nœuds GBIF à utiliser pour élaborer leurs propres lignes directrices internes. Les organisations et les institutions ont été encouragées à produire leurs propres documents internes en prenant en compte les pratiques décrites dans le _Guide_ et les documents connexes tels que le https://doi. rg/10.15468/doc-2zpf-zf42[_Guide des bonnes pratiques pour le géoréférencement_^] (Chapman et Wieczorek 2006) et les incorporer dans leur propre environnement de travail. Malheureusement, pas autant d'institutions que nous l'avions espéré n'ont relevé le défi et produit leurs propres documents internes. Toutefois, deux agences clés l'ont fait : SANBI en Afrique du Sud (http://biodiversityadvisor.sanbi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SANBI-Biodiversity-Information-Policy-Series-Digital-Access-to-Sensitive-Taxon. df[SANBI 2010^]) et Atlas of Living Australia (https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/ALA-sensitive-data-report-and-proposed-policy-v1.1.pdf[Tann and Flemons 2009^], https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000195500-what-is-sensitive-data-[ALA 2018a^]) (voir <<Implementations,Implementations>>)."

For that reason, a set of principles are elucidated below. Key among these is the need to make biodiversity information freely available wherever possible, in the interests of science, the environment and biodiversity itself."

msgid "Ethics and biodiversity is a topic that has received little coverage, although for hundreds of years biologists have followed implied ethics in their work. The management of data on sensitive data requires considerable ethical practice and in many cases, a lot of trust and collaboration. Often amateur biologists and citizen scientists are aware of the locations of sensitive taxa, and it is up to the biologists to work with these groups to ensure the continued survival of the species. This won’t always be possible as there will always be rogues, but collaboration can work. For example, working with amateur groups to ethically bring rare plants into cultivation so that there is less pressure on the wild populations."
msgstr "Éthique et biodiversité est un sujet qui a été peu couvert, bien que depuis des centaines d'années, les biologistes aient suivi une éthique implicite dans leur travail. La gestion de données sur des données sensibles nécessite une pratique éthique considérable et, dans de nombreux cas, une grande confiance et une grande collaboration. Souvent, les biologistes amateurs et les scientifiques citoyens sont conscients des emplacements des taxons sensibles, et il appartient aux biologistes de travailler avec ces groupes pour assurer la survie de l'espèce. Cela ne sera pas toujours possible car il y aura toujours des voyous, mais la collaboration peut fonctionner. Par exemple, travailler avec des groupes amateurs pour mettre en culture des plantes rares, de manière éthique, afin de réduire la pression sur les populations sauvages."

msgid "It would appear that herbaria are more inclined to restrict their data than mammal or insect collections (https://doi.org/10.35035/vs84-0p13[Chapman 2006^]). Perhaps this is because plants don’t move and the exact location of a collection is likely to lead one to an actual plant on the ground, whereas mammals and insects tend to move around. One entomologist commented that professional collectors and amateur groups often know more than the scientists about the location of rare species. However, there are categories of animals where the exact locations were thought to be sensitive and included bat roosting and maternity sites, nesting sites of falcons, and the location of various lizards, tortoise, butterfly species and large mammals. With plants, there is also a strong leaning towards not making information available for plants likely to be collected (pirated) such as cacti in Arizona, orchids and cycads. The protection of sensitive fossil sites was also identified. One unfortunate aspect is the susceptibility of a small number of taxa in a group (such as a few charismatic cacti, or orchids, etc.). This can often mean that all taxa in that group are then regarded as sensitive and the data on them restricted, even though many of those taxa are not themselves sensitive or susceptible to harmful acts."

msgid "On the other hand, some institutions have found benefit in working with the general public to gather information and to protect rare taxa, using the public and special interest groups to survey existing locations and to help locate new locations. There are good examples with birds, lizards, frogs, butterflies and various plant species (including orchids) in a number of countries. Several people have raised the issue of the balance between protecting taxa through knowledge of where they occur as opposed to protection through restricting knowledge of their occurrence at a location. This is very taxon (and maybe region) specific and certain taxa may be in greater danger due to inadvertent destruction through lack of knowledge than through deliberate collection and destruction through knowledge of locations. For this reason, a list of sensitive taxa should be quite different to a list of rare or threatened taxa, although there is likely to be considerable overlap between the two. It should be noted, also, that what is sensitive today, may not be sensitive tomorrow and vice versa, and this should lead to review on a periodic basis to determine whether the context has changed over time (http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2011/rncan-nrcan/M104-4-2010-eng.pdf[AMEC Earth and Environmental 2010^])."

This is an issue of concern to biologists and especially to taxonomists (https://www.chronicle.com/article/Endangered-by-Research/26117[Guterman 2006^]) – how much information should be released in publication when describing a new taxon. There are a number of examples in coral-reef fish where a new species has appeared in the commercial trade soon after it is scientifically described."

Thus, it is usually not considered so much of a ‘problem’, but rather a sort of ‘symbiotic’ relationship between the commercial trade and the taxonomists. Moreover, in such cases in reef fishes, the species has eluded prior discovery not so much because it is rare or has an extremely restricted distribution, but because it simply lives somewhere that scientists have not yet been able to survey. Hence, there are usually few, if any, conservation implications in this context."

Currently, GBIF.org has only limited ability to incorporate polygon data. There are some parallels with this method with the reporting of census results in many countries where summaries are reported using Statistical Local Areas or census tracts to restrict possible identification of individuals (https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/23d04985e1786824ca25720b0002bb18!OpenDocument[Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006]). A key difference is that with census data results are summarized over many individuals within a region, whereas with biological data we want to hide the location of a single entity within an area. It does de facto produce a summary, but this is not the primary intent. One problem with this method is that there is no guarantee that political (or even biogeographic) boundaries will remain constant over time and this further reduces the value of the data for many purposes. This has already been found to be a problem when comparing census data over time where census districts or tracts have altered. (https://doi.org/10.1080/01615440.2011.563228[Noble et al. 2011])."

If the geometry given does not completely encompass the original spatial representation, then the spatial fit is zero (i.e., some of the original is outside the transformed version, which we interpret as not being a fit). If the transformed shape does completely encompass the original spatial representation, then the value of the spatial fit is the ratio of the area of the transformed geometry to the area of the original spatial representation. Special case: If the original spatial representation is a point and the geometry presented in not a point, then the spatial fit is undefined."

Jurisdictions often have individual circumstances (legal, ethical, practical, etc.) that may dictate the way their own policies need to be implemented. In developing your own policies, in addition to relying on this document, you may wish to look at those jurisdictional policies. I would caution, however, in diverting too far away from the criteria and principles laid out in this document, due to the complications that may arise in sharing data, especially through aggregating and publishing initiatives such as GBIF. The main purpose of this document is to encourage the adoption and use of standardized methodologies. Most of the jurisdictional documents will, of necessity, go further than this document which is only based around generalization. This document does not go into other aspects such as the privacy of individuals, licensing, etc. Any derived works should be made publicly accessible and clearly lay out the policies with respect to the publication and sharing of data.
