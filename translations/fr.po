msgid "The unprotected distribution of Sensitive Primary Species Occurrence Data (for example the exact localities of rare, endangered or commercially valuable taxa) was a concern of https://www.gbif.org[GBIF] – the Global Biodiversity Information Facility – from its beginning. The GBIF Secretariat has a vested interest in making data available via its portals, but at the same time respecting the wishes of data providers to restrict information on sensitive taxa. In early 2006, GBIF initiated a process to address this issue, especially in relation to data to be shared through the GBIF network and made visible through https://www.gbif.org[GBIF.org^] and other data aggregating initiatives."

Organizations and institutions were encouraged to produce their own internal documents that incorporated the practices outlined in the _Guide_ and related documents such as the https://doi.org/10.15468/doc-2zpf-zf42[_Guide to Best Practices for Georeferencing_^] (Chapman and Wieczorek 2006) and incorporate them into their own working environment. Unfortunately, not as many institutions have taken up the challenge and produced their own internal documents as we had hoped. Two key agencies that have done so, however, are SANBI in South Africa (http://biodiversityadvisor.sanbi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/SANBI-Biodiversity-Information-Policy-Series-Digital-Access-to-Sensitive-Taxon.pdf[SANBI 2010^]) and the Atlas of Living Australia (https://www.ala.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/ALA-sensitive-data-report-and-proposed-policy-v1.1.pdf[Tann and Flemons 2009^], https://support.ala.org.au/support/solutions/articles/6000195500-what-is-sensitive-data-[ALA 2018a^]) (see <<Implementations,Implementations>>)."

The management of data on sensitive data requires considerable ethical practice and in many cases, a lot of trust and collaboration. Often amateur biologists and citizen scientists are aware of the locations of sensitive taxa, and it is up to the biologists to work with these groups to ensure the continued survival of the species. This won’t always be possible as there will always be rogues, but collaboration can work. For example, working with amateur groups to ethically bring rare plants into cultivation so that there is less pressure on the wild populations."

msgid "As a first step, information holders need to identify any data which are regarded as ‘<<sensitive-data,sensitive>>’. Sensitive information is any, which if released to the public, would result in an ‘adverse effect’ on the taxon or attribute in question or to a living individual. A number of factors need to be taken into account when determining sensitivity, including the type and level of threat, vulnerability of the taxon or attribute, type of information and whether it is already publicly available. Determining these factors leads us to a criteria-based approach."

msgid "It would appear that herbaria are more inclined to restrict their data than mammal or insect collections (https://doi.org/10.35035/vs84-0p13[Chapman 2006^]). Perhaps this is because plants don’t move and the exact location of a collection is likely to lead one to an actual plant on the ground, whereas mammals and insects tend to move around. One entomologist commented that professional collectors and amateur groups often know more than the scientists about the location of rare species. However, there are categories of animals where the exact locations were thought to be sensitive and included bat roosting and maternity sites, nesting sites of falcons, and the location of various lizards, tortoise, butterfly species and large mammals. With plants, there is also a strong leaning towards not making information available for plants likely to be collected (pirated) such as cacti in Arizona, orchids and cycads. The protection of sensitive fossil sites was also identified. One unfortunate aspect is the susceptibility of a small number of taxa in a group (such as a few charismatic cacti, or orchids, etc.). This can often mean that all taxa in that group are then regarded as sensitive and the data on them restricted, even though many of those taxa are not themselves sensitive or susceptible to harmful acts."

#: 200.en.adoc:10
msgid "On the other hand, some institutions have found benefit in working with the general public to gather information and to protect rare taxa, using the public and special interest groups to survey existing locations and to help locate new locations. There are good examples with birds, lizards, frogs, butterflies and various plant species (including orchids) in a number of countries. Several people have raised the issue of the balance between protecting taxa through knowledge of where they occur as opposed to protection through restricting knowledge of their occurrence at a location. This is very taxon (and maybe region) specific and certain taxa may be in greater danger due to inadvertent destruction through lack of knowledge than through deliberate collection and destruction through knowledge of locations. For this reason, a list of sensitive taxa should be quite different to a list of rare or threatened taxa, although there is likely to be considerable overlap between the two. It should be noted, also, that what is sensitive today, may not be sensitive tomorrow and vice versa, and this should lead to review on a periodic basis to determine whether the context has changed over time (http://publications.gc.ca/collections/collection_2011/rncan-nrcan/M104-4-2010-eng.pdf[AMEC Earth and Environmental 2010^])."

This is an issue of concern to biologists and especially to taxonomists (https://www.chronicle.com/article/Endangered-by-Research/26117[Guterman 2006^]) – how much information should be released in publication when describing a new taxon.

Thus, it is usually not considered so much of a ‘problem’, but rather a sort of ‘symbiotic’ relationship between the commercial trade and the taxonomists. Moreover, in such cases in reef fishes, the species has eluded prior discovery not so much because it is rare or has an extremely restricted distribution, but because it simply lives somewhere that scientists have not yet been able to survey.

How each of these should be handled with respect to determining location and uncertainty, see https://doi.org/10.15468/doc-gg7h-s853[Chapman and Wieczorek (2020)]. We recommend the use of a geographic grid, as discussed below, because of the ease of preparation and documentation, and because biological data being shared via the Darwin Core standard (https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0029715[Wieczorek et al. 2012]) would need to be converted from a metric grid to a geographic grid before publication, with subsequent loss of precision.

msgid "Where data is generalized to a geographic or biogeographic region (a polygon), the data has less usability for many analyses, but was seen by many as a more secure way of ‘hiding’ sensitive data locations. Currently, GBIF.org has only limited ability to incorporate polygon data. There are some parallels with this method with the reporting of census results in many countries where summaries are reported using Statistical Local Areas or census tracts to restrict possible identification of individuals (https://www.abs.gov.au/AUSSTATS/abs@.nsf/bb8db737e2af84b8ca2571780015701e/23d04985e1786824ca25720b0002bb18!OpenDocument[Australian Bureau of Statistics 2006]). A key difference is that with census data results are summarized over many individuals within a region, whereas with biological data we want to hide the location of a single entity within an area. It does de facto produce a summary, but this is not the primary intent. One problem with this method is that there is no guarantee that political (or even biogeographic) boundaries will remain constant over time and this further reduces the value of the data for many purposes. This has already been found to be a problem when comparing census data over time where census districts or tracts have altered. (https://doi.org/10.1080/01615440.2011.563228[Noble et al. 2011])."

Currently, however, there is no universal global system available.

Also, in the chapter on <<Determining sensitivity,Determining sensitivity>>, a series of documentation processes were recommended (<<table-01,Table 1>>).
